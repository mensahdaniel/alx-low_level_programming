## Concepts
For this project, you are expected to be familiar with the following concept:
- C programming

## Resources
Read or watch the following resources:
- [Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf](Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf) (You do not have to learn everything in there yet, but make sure you read it entirely first)
- Dennis Ritchie
- "C" Programming Language: Brian Kernighan
- Why C Programming Is Awesome
- Learning to program in C part 1
- Learning to program in C part 2
- Understanding C program Compilation Process
- Betty Coding Style
- Hash-bang under the hood (Look at only after you finish consuming the other resources)
- Linus Torvalds on C vs. C++ (Look at only after you finish consuming the other resources)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without the help of Google:
- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type `gcc main.c`
- What is an entry point
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program

## Copyright - Plagiarism
Please note that you are responsible for coming up with solutions for the tasks in this project. Copying and pasting someone else's work is not allowed. Publishing any content of this project is strictly forbidden, and any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
### C
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- There should be no errors or warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use the `system` function
- Your code should use the Betty style. You can use `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` to check your code style.

### Shell Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`

## Quiz Questions
- Q: In which category does the C programming language belong?
  - Compiled language
- Q: Which of the following are both valid comment syntaxes in ANSI C and Betty-compliant?
  - `/* Comment */`
  - `// Comment`

## Tasks
### 0. Preprocessor
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

### 1. Compiler
Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

### 2. Assembler
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.

### 3. Name
Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

### 4. Hello, puts
Write a C program that prints the string "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the `puts` function.

### 5. Hello, printf
Write a C program that prints the string "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," using the `printf` function.

### 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

## Directory Structure
- `0x00-hello_world`: Main directory containing all the task files and scripts.
